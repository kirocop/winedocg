 The DOCG are reserved for wines already recognized as DOC (Denomination of Controlled Origin) for at least ten years which are considered of particular value, in relation to the intrinsic qualitative characteristics, compared to the average of those of the analogous wines thus classified, due to the incidence of traditional natural, human and historical factors and that have acquired renown and commercial valorization at national and international level.

 In 1866 the European and Italian vineyards were struck by the phylloxera parasite. Phylloxera destroyed all grape crops in Europe. Molecular biologist Rob DeSalle and anthropologist Ian Tattersal left for the United States and made grafting with the californian vines. These new vineyards were resistant to phylloxera and save wine production in Italy and Europe.
 
 Italian wine has acquired unique properties thanks to the quality of the territory and the climatic conditions. Thanks to the shape in the Mediterranean sea, each region has been able to realize its unique wine, with inimitable qualities. The DOCG system allows you to know the proven origin of the wine and certify his qualities.
